Background\nThis document summarises the documentation and the nding of the peer review of the trigger\nused in OCHA\u2019s Philippines Anticipatory Action framework for typhoons. The impact prediction\nmodel used as the basis for the trigger was developed by the Netherlands Red Cross 510 data\nand digital team, on behalf of the IFRC network and its partners. The model uses typhoon track\nand rainfall forecasts to predict the percentage of houses that will be severely damaged per\nmunicipality in the Philippines. OCHA Philippines used this model as a basis to begin a response\nbefore a typhoon hit, based on the predicted number of houses damaged in the regions of Bicol\nand Eastern Visayas. To nd out more about this application, please see the Anticipatory Action\nFramework for the Philippines.\nThis peer review was conducted between September 2021 and July 2022.\n2. Main Findings and Recommendations\nThe documentation regarding the model, its application and the review process can be found at\nthe following links:\n\u25cf The Model Card describes version 1.0 of the model and was completed in September\n2021.\n\u25cf The Model Evaluation Matrix was completed in October 2021 by a technical expert from\nLeiden University, and in February 2022 by the client.\n\u25cf The Implementation Plan was completed in October 2021. It summarises the concrete\nactions that the model will trigger or inform as part of the 2021-2022 OCHA anticipatory\naction framework in the Philippines\n\u25cf The Ethical Matrix aims to identify all stakeholders and potential issues regarding the\nintended use of the model. It was completed in November 2021 by an expert from the\nLondon School of Economics; and updated in July 2022.\nA summary of the main ndings and recommendations is provided below.\n2.1 Technical Review\nIntended Use\n\u25cf The target of the model is P (#damaged houses > threshold t). Several combinations of\nProbability P and threshold t are used as a trigger for early action. Make a clear\nstatement under which circumstance which combination is used. This will help with later\nevaluation of the model and transparency of its use.\nModel Development\n\u25cf As mentioned in the ethical review, more information about the sources of the input data\nis desirable. The model should include information on how often the data sets are\nupdated, and how often the model is retrained to reect these updates.\nModel Evaluation\n\u25cf The model is compared against a damage curve that is currently used to estimate\ndamage. Adjust this benchmark to whichever model or algorithm is used by the\nPhilippine authorities to estimate damage.\n\u25cf Specify how much variance in model performance is acceptable, i.e., with the model\nworking on average better than the benchmark, how much extreme over \/\nunderestimation is acceptable for eld use. More specically, indicate how robust the\nmodel performance is over different typhoons.\nOperational Readiness\n\u25cf For every model version, make a model release and keep an updated list of associated\ninput data. This will make reproducibility of earlier results easier and help keep track of\nthe data sources (and whose responsibility those are).\n2.2 Ethical Review\nInaccuracy\nThe model performance scores for 2021 Typhoon Surigae are not reported. The rationale for\nusing the given error \/ accuracy tool and not others is missing. The model does not perform well\nat predicting really low and really high damage.\n\u25cf Recommendation: (1) Report latest error scores; (2) Contextualise the quality of the error\nscores in light of existing and relevant research; (3) Include the rationale for using a\nparticular method of calculating error score as opposed to others.\nFalse Negatives\nIn the case of Typhoon Goni in 2020, the model did not predict an extreme event until only a few\nhours before landfall.\n\u25cf Recommendation: If the model does have 100% weightage in the activation of the\ntrigger, then the possibility of a false negative should be clear operationally, e.g., in the\ncase of Typhoon Goni. This is of particular importance because we know that the model\ndoes perform well in cases of rapid intensication or high damage scenarios.\nMissing Attributes\nThe implementation model mentions a priority list based on poverty, gender, and building material,\nwhile the model uses poverty, hazard data, and building type where poverty is not disaggregated\nunless it follows some national standard of income levels to estimate poverty lines.\n\u25cf Recommendation: Clarity is required on the relative importance of variables used, and\nconsistency between the model and the implementation plan. There needs to be a\ndistinction drawn between the model and how the outputs of the model are used. Clear\ndelineation between input data (inclusion \/ exclusion criteria etc.); modelling process,\noutput, and use; and validation \/ verication, with a clear trail of documentation.\nLead Times\nLead time is the length of time between when a forecast is output and the occurrence of the\nshock that was forecasted. It is unclear the impact that forecast running time has on lead times\nfor implementation. In the case of Typhoon Ursula (Phanfone) in 2019, the trigger was reached\nonly 12 hours prior to landfall for which no humanitarian action could be planned.\n\u25cf Recommendation: In the implementation plan, more clarity is required on potential\noperational impact of long lead times, especially with 100% weightage of model output\nfor trigger activation. The effect of different lead times is unclear for the implementation.\nTo quote one of the documents: 'It takes several hours for the forecast to run so the\ninitial conditions are already often outdated'.\nDecision Support\nDecision support concerns the extent to which action based on model output.\n\u25cf Recommendation: Clarity is required in the implementation plan about weightage of\nmodel output on trigger activation, i.e., how much of the decision to act depends on the\nmodel output. If this is not 100%, then the other considerations should be described.\n\u25cf Recommendation: Given the possibility of a false negative, operational readiness in case\nof model failure should be detailed in the implementation plan.\nStatistical Bias\nStatistical bias occurs when a model or statistic is not representative of the underlying\npopulation. In this model, different input datasets are used to model different typhoon scenarios,\nsocial vulnerability \/ poverty data is not suciently disaggregated for evaluation, and the relative\nimportance \/ weightage of the variables in the model is unclear.\n\u25cf Recommendation: The model requires clear documentation of the different datasets\nused, particularly the rationale behind parameters used and their disaggregation, e.g.,\npoverty index. Discrepancies on this front exist between the model card and\nimplementation plan, and the model would benet from their harmonisation. It would\nalso be useful to include these in an overview of the model development process, i.e., the\nrelative weighting and importance of these variables, and how the model changes when\nthey change.\nLack of Transparency\nThe model is open source and has undergone technical review but is missing some\ndocumentation.\n\u25cf Recommendation: The model would benet from better documentation of the modelling\nprocess, rationale for the algorithm selection, its tness for purpose, inclusion\/ exclusion\ncriteria for variables, etc.\nSystemic Bias\nSystemic bias is the inherent tendency of a process to support specic outcomes. In this mode,\nsocial vulnerability and poverty data are not substantially disaggregated. The move from 'common\ndataset' to 'composite dataset' involved ranking of variables.\n\u25cf Recommendation: Clarity, rationale and disaggregation of parameters like social\nvulnerability and poverty would be benecial. Clarity required in relative weights of\nvariables when ranking."},{"from":"gpt","value":"{\n  \"modelReport\": {\n    \"title\": \"Typhoon Impact Model\",\n    \"initiative\": \"510 - An initiative of the Netherlands Red Cross\",\n    \"date\": \"August 2022\",\n    \"background\": {\n      \"description\": \"This document summarises the documentation and the findings of the peer review of the trigger used in OCHA\u2019s Philippines Anticipatory Action framework for typhoons.\",\n      \"modelDeveloper\": \"Netherlands Red Cross 510 data and digital team\",\n      \"modelPurpose\": \"To predict the percentage of houses that will be severely damaged per municipality in the Philippines\"\n    },\n    \"mainFindingsAndRecommendations\": {\n      \"technicalReview\": {\n        \"intendedUse\": {\n          \"description\": \"The target of the model is P (#damaged houses > threshold t)\",\n          \"recommendation\": \"Make a clear statement under which circumstance which combination is used\"\n        },\n        \"modelDevelopment\": {\n          \"description\": \"More information about the sources of the input data is desirable\",\n          \"recommendation\": \"Include information on how often the data sets are updated, and how often the model is retrained to reflect these updates\"\n        },\n        \"modelEvaluation\": {\n          \"description\": \"The model is compared against a damage curve that is currently used to estimate damage\",\n          \"recommendation\": \"Adjust this benchmark to whichever model or algorithm is used by the Philippine authorities to estimate damage\"\n        },\n        \"operationalReadiness\": {\n          \"description\": \"For every model version, make a model release and keep an updated list of associated input data\",\n          \"recommendation\": \"This will make reproducibility of earlier results easier and help keep track of the data sources\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"ethicalReview\": {\n        \"inaccuracy\": {\n          \"description\": \"The model performance scores for 2021 Typhoon Surigae are not reported\",\n          \"recommendation\": \"Report latest error scores, contextualise the quality of the error scores, and include the rationale for using a particular method of calculating error score\"\n        },\n        \"falseNegatives\": {\n          \"description\": \"In the case of Typhoon Goni in 2020, the model did not predict an extreme event until only a few hours before landfall\",\n          \"recommendation\": \"If the model does have 100% weightage in the activation of the trigger, then the possibility of a false negative should be clear operationally\"\n        },\n        \"missingAttributes\": {\n          \"description\": \"The implementation model mentions a priority list based on poverty, gender, and building material, while the model uses poverty, hazard data, and building type\",\n          \"recommendation\": \"Clarity is required on the relative importance of variables used, and consistency between the model and the implementation plan\"\n        },\n        \"leadTimes\": {\n          \"description\": \"Lead time is the length of time between when a forecast is output and the occurrence of the shock that was forecasted\",\n          \"recommendation\": \"In the implementation plan, more clarity is required on potential operational impact of long lead times\"\n        },\n        \"decisionSupport\": {\n          \"description\": \"Decision support concerns the extent to which action based on model output\",\n          \"recommendation\": \"Clarity is required in the implementation plan about weightage of model output on trigger activation\"\n        },\n        \"statisticalBias\": {\n          \"description\": \"Statistical bias occurs when a model or statistic is not representative of the underlying population\",\n          \"recommendation\": \"The model requires clear documentation of the different datasets used, particularly the rationale behind parameters used and their disaggregation\"\n        },\n        \"lackOfTransparency\": {\n          \"description\": \"The model is open source and has undergone technical review but is missing some documentation\",\n          \"recommendation\": \"The model would benefit from better documentation of the modelling process, rationale for the algorithm selection, its fitness for purpose, inclusion\/exclusion criteria for variables, etc.\"\n        },\n        \"systemicBias\": {\n          \"description\": \"Systemic bias is the inherent tendency of a process to support specific outcomes\",\n          \"recommendation\": \"Clarity, rationale and disaggregation of parameters like social vulnerability and poverty would be beneficial\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}"}]}

Res. Lett., 36, L19803,\ndoi:10.1029\/2009GL040248.\n1. Introduction\n[2] The production of tropospheric ozone (O3), a criteria\nair pollutant and potent greenhouse gas, is a complex\nfunction of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2), volatile\norganic compounds (VOC), sunlight, and trace oxidants\nsuch as the hydroxyl radical (OH). O3 production is nonlinearly dependent on NOx abundance and thus accurate\ndescription of the processes that remove NOx radicals is\ncritical for predicting the down-wind influence of anthropogenic emissions on tropospheric O3. Global modeling\nstudies suggest that nocturnal processes involving the\nreactions of the nitrate radical (NO3) and N2O5 account\nfor 50% of the globally averaged annual net NOx removal\n[Dentener and Crutzen, 1993]. However, the impact of\nnocturnal NOx removal processes on the tropospheric O3\nbudget continues to be limited by uncertainty in the reaction\nrate of N2O5 with aerosol particles.\n[3] The influence of N2O5 on the removal of atmospheric\nNOx radicals is determined by the product of the probability\nthat N2O5 will react on a particle given a collision, g(N2O5),\nand the total gas-particle collision frequency primarily set\nby the available particle surface area concentration (Sa).\nUntil recently, direct measurements of g(N2O5) have been\nrestricted to the laboratory, where simplified model particle\ntypes are probed to ascertain functional dependences. These\nstudies have shown that N2O5 removal by particles and the\nresulting products are strongly dependent on: i) liquid water\ncontent (H2O(l)) [Thornton et al., 2003], ii) particle nitrate\n(NO3\n), which inhibits N2O5 hydrolysis [Wahner et al.,\n1998], iii) the presence of additional nucleophiles in water\nstressed particles [Behnke et al., 1997], iv) organic coatings\nthat have been theorized to either suppress N2O5 accommodation or decrease water availability at the surface\n[McNeill et al., 2006; Folkers et al., 2003], and v) particle\nacidity [Mozurkewich and Calvert, 1988]. These effects\nlead to measured g(N2O5) that span three orders of magnitude (1  104 < g < 0.1) depending on the chemical and\nphysical properties of the particles employed. Consistent\nwith this large potential variability, recent analyses of NO3\nand N2O5 field measurements have inferred that g(N2O5)\ncan range from 1  103 to 0.017 and is likely dependent\non particle chemical composition [Brown et al., 2006].\n[4] In the context of atmospheric particle composition,\nthe importance of the above dependences, either individually or as a whole, remains entirely unclear. Combining our\ndirect measurements of g(N2O5) on ambient particles with\nco-located observations of particle chemical composition\nand particle Sa, gas phase precursors, and meteorological\nparameters, allows such evaluations and the elucidation of\nfactors that most likely control g(N2O5) on ambient particles.\n2. Experimental Design\n[5] The pseudo-first order rate coefficient for N2O5 loss\nto aerosol particles (khet) was measured directly using an\nentrained aerosol flow reactor coupled to a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) [Kercher et al., 2009].\nThe experimental technique is described in detail elsewhere\n[Bertram et al., 2009]. Observations of g(N2O5) were made\nat two urban sampling locations during the summer of 2008.\nBetween July 3rd and 21st, observations were made from a\n10 m tower adjacent to the NOAA Earth System Research\nLaboratory in Boulder, CO. Particle size distributions (65 nm\nto 1 mm) were measured by an ultra-high sensitivity aerosol\nspectrometer and particle composition measured by an\nAerodyne compact time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer\n[DeCarlo et al., 2006; Drewnick et al., 2005]. Coincident\nmeasurements of gas-phase precursors (e.g., O3 and NO)\nand basic meteorological parameters were also made during\nthe sampling period. Between August 6th and 16th, observations were made from a 5 m sampling mast extending\nabove an instrument sea container located at the NOAA\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 36, L19803, doi:10.1029\/2009GL040248, 2009 Click\nHere for\nFull\nArticle\n1\nDepartment of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington,\nSeattle, Washington, USA. 2\nNow at Department of Chemistry, University of California, San Diego,\nLa Jolla, California, USA. 3\nDepartment of Chemistry, University of Washington, Seattle,\nWashington, USA. 4\nEarth System Research Laboratory, NOAA, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n5\nCIRES, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n6\nPacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, NOAA, Seattle, Washington,\nUSA.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/09\/2009GL040248$05.00\nL19803 1 of 5\nPacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, 10 km NE of\ndowntown Seattle, WA. Particle size distributions (10 nm to\n10 mm) were measured with two differential mobility\nparticle sizing instruments and aerodynamic particle sizer.\nSub-micron particle composition was measured by an\nAerodyne quadrupole aerosol mass spectrometer [Jayne et\nal., 2000].\n[6] We interpret these results using a newly developed\nparameterization of g(N2O5) [Bertram and Thornton, 2009]\nthat is driven by observations of particle composition and\nRH, and calculations of H2O(l) as determined by the aerosol\ninorganics model (AIM Model II) [Carslaw et al., 1995].\nThis approach permits us to directly assess the dependence\nof the observed g(N2O5) on the factors outlined in section 1.\n3. Observed Dependence of g(N2O5) on Particle\nChemical Composition\n[7] In Boulder, the ambient RH was low (30 \u00b1 15%),\nparticle loadings were rather uniform (mean Sa = 108 \u00b1 35,\ntotal mass = 5.3 \u00b1 1.5 mg m3\n), and particles contained high\norganic mass fractions (mean organic\/sulfate mass ratio =\n6.1 \u00b1 3.9). The median g(N2O5) observed in Boulder was\n0.003 (interquartile range of 0.9\u2013 1.2  103\n). In contrast,\nin Seattle, the ambient RH was higher (74 \u00b1 13%), particle\nloadings were enhanced and more variable (mean Sa = 190 \u00b1\n115, total mass = 7.2 \u00b1 4.1 mg m3\n), but particles had similar\nbulk particle chemical composition as in Boulder (mean\norganic\/sulfate = 7.1 \u00b1 4.8). The median g(N2O5) observed\nin Seattle was 0.009 (interquartile range of 0.26 \u2013 2.9\n102\n), a factor of three larger than measured in Boulder.\n[8] These differences in the median g(N2O5) are grossly\nconsistent with the difference in RH between the two\nlocations leading to lower H2O(l) in Boulder relative to\nSeattle. But, RH alone is not sufficient for describing either\nthe observed variability in, or the level of suppression of\ng(N2O5) relative to that expected on aqueous solution\nparticles. For example, the strongly decreasing trend of\ng(N2O5) with the increasing mass ratio of particulate\norganic matter (POM) to sulfate (SO4\n2) observed in the\nSeattle data, and the lack of such a correlation in the\nBoulder data (Figure 1a), provide insights into the particle\ncharacteristics that exert control over g(N2O5). In what\nfollows, we investigate the dependence of g(N2O5) on\nPOM, making the reasonable assumption that the aerosol\nparticles are largely internal mixtures [Murphy et al., 2006]\n(see auxiliary material).1\n[9] In the absence of POM, g(N2O5) should be controlled\nby the RH-dependent liquid water content and the molarity\nof nucleophiles such as NO3\n and chloride (Cl) [Bertram\nand Thornton, 2009; Griffiths et al., 2009; Wahner et al.,\n1998; Behnke et al., 1997]. In both locations studied, when\nPOM\/SO4\n2 was lowest, the non-refractory particle composition was mainly ammonium sulfate (AS) with trace NO3\n\nand Cl (Figure S1), and our observations of g(N2O5) are in\ngood agreement with both laboratory measurements and the\nparameterization of Bertram and Thornton [2009]. Probing\nthe response of g(N2O5) to an increasing mass fraction of\nPOM, in both Boulder and Seattle, permits us to assess the\npotential affects of POM on g(N2O5). POM has been\nsuggested to influence g(N2O5) via: i) altering H2O(l),\nwhich has been shown to influence g(N2O5) either through\na direct H2O(l) limitation [Thornton et al., 2003] or by\nchanging particle [H2O(l)]\/[NO3\n] [Mentel et al., 1999], and\/\nor ii) the formation of organic coatings on aqueous cores\nthat inhibit the accommodation or reaction of N2O5 [Badger\net al., 2006; McNeill et al., 2006; Folkers et al., 2003].\n[10] The small g(N2O5) values and lack of correlation\nwith POM observed in Boulder indicates that the particles\nsampled were either solid (independent of POM mass\nfraction) or that increases in POM did not lead to the\nassociated increase in H2O(l) required to enhance g(N2O5).\nInterestingly, our observed g(N2O5) values are consistent\nwith that predicted by the Bertram and Thornton [2009]\nparameterization regardless of the AS phase state. Laboratory measurements of g(N2O5) are <0.005 on crystalline AS\n[Mozurkewich and Calvert, 1988], similar to the median of\n0.003 observed in Boulder. If AS crystallization was\ninhibited by the available POM [Parsons et al., 2004] and\nwe treat POM as hygroscopic (i.e. malonic acid like),\nFigure 1. (a) Observed dependence of g(N2O5) on the\nmass ratio of POM to SO4\n2 for measurements made in\nSeattle (black) and Boulder (gray). (b) Calculated dependence of the molar ratio of H2O(l) to NO3\n on the mass ratio\nof POM to SO4\n2 for measurements made in Seattle,\nassuming that POM does (circles) and does not (squares)\ncontribute to H2O(l) uptake. Data points are equal\npopulation binned medians, where the bar corresponds to\nthe interquartile range of the calculations. The shaded\nregion (in panel b) represents values of [H2O(l)]\/[NO3\n]\nwhere laboratory measurements predict suppression in\ng(N2O5) due to the NO3\n effect.\n1\nAuxiliary materials are available in the HTML. doi:10.1029\/\n2009GL040248.\nL19803 BERTRAM ET AL.: DIRECT OBSERVATIONS OF N2O5 REACTIVITY L19803\n2 of 5\ncalculations made using the Bertram and Thornton [2009]\nparameterization show that at the low RH sampled,\n[H2O(l)]\/[NO3\n] is low enough to significantly suppress\ng(N2O5) to <0.005 across the entire range of POM\/SO4\n2\nobserved in Boulder. Co-located measurements of g(N2O5)\nand particle phase state [Martin et al., 2008] will clearly\nallow such distinctions to be made in the future.\n[11] The behavior of g(N2O5) observed in Seattle, at\nhigher RH, more clearly illustrates the importance of\nunderstanding POM in order to assess the factors controlling g(N2O5). The dependence of g(N2O5) on POM\/SO4\n2\nwas observed during a stagnation episode in which most of\nthe POM mass growth was likely due to SOA formation as\nindicated by the fraction of POM that is measured to be\nhighly oxidized (see Figure S4). In light of the above\nexpectations, the decreasing g(N2O5) with increasing\nPOM\/SO4\n2 can be hypothesized to be a result of: i) a\nrelative decrease in the particulate water mass fraction,\nfollowing increased partitioning of organics that are less\nhygroscopic than AS (i.e. DH2O(l)\/DPOM \u0004 0), leading to\nboth an increased nitrate effect [Wahner et al., 1998] and a\npossible H2O(l) limitation [Thornton et al., 2003], and\/or\nii) an increasing role of organic coatings that limit either\nN2O5 surface accommodation or N2O5 accessibility to\nH2O(l).\n[12] To examine these suppositions, we first calculate\n[H2O(l)] and [H2O(l)]\/[NO3\n] using AIM for the two\nextremes of POM hygroscopicity: i) POM does not contribute to H2O(l) uptake, and ii) POM is highly hygroscopic,\ncontributing significantly to H2O(l) (POM treated as\nmalonic acid) (Figure 1b). In both cases [H2O(l)] is sufficiently high (>20M), so as not to suppress g(N2O5) directly.\nThe molar ratio of H2O(l) to NO3\n remains nearly constant\nwhen POM is allowed to contribute to H2O(l), but decreases\nwith increasing POM\/SO4\n2 when POM is prohibited from\ncontributing to H2O(l). To determine whether the calculated\nchanges in [H2O(l)]\/[NO3\n] are sufficient for describing the\nobserved changes in g(N2O5), we use the parameterization\nfor g(N2O5) described by Bertram and Thornton [2009].\n[13] Figure 2 depicts the parameterization-observation\ncomparison for both cases as a function of the molar ratio\nof H2O(l) to NO3\n. The strong parameterization-observation\nagreement, shown in panel A, lends support to the conclusion that POM sampled in Seattle did not contribute\nsignificantly to H2O(l). Such a notion would be generally\nconsistent with the findings of Mochida et al. [2008] and\nQuinn et al. [2005], where ambient observations revealed\ndecreases in RH-dependent particle growth factors or scattering efficiency in the presence of large organic mass\nfractions. Based on our observations alone, we cannot rule\nout the possibility that organic coatings may act to offset the\neffects of hygroscopic organics (Figure 2b). Nonetheless, it\nis clear that the presence and chemical properties of POM\nplay a decisive role in setting g(N2O5) in the troposphere.\nFurther measurements of g(N2O5) downwind of source\nregions, where POM is likely more oxidized [Zhang et\nal., 2007], and more hygroscopic [Kondo et al., 2007], and\/\nor alongside co-located observations of particle hygroscopic\ngrowth will be strong tests of this hypothesis and the\napplicability of these first results to regional and global\nmodels.\n4. Implications for NOx Processing Rates\n[14] Quantifying the absolute magnitude of g(N2O5) and\nultimately the loss rate of N2O5 to particles is necessary for\nreliable model representations of NOx, OH, O3, and particle\nabundances and the couplings between them. The sensitivity of the NOx budget to g(N2O5) is a strong function of the\nNO3 and N2O5 production rates, Sa, temperature, and NO3\nreactivity. To assess the importance of g(N2O5) we examine\nthe fraction of NOx present at sunset, [NOx]sunset, that is lost\nat night as a function of g(N2O5).\nFlost \u00bc \u00bd \u0005 NOx Sunset  \u00bd \u0005 NOx Sunrise\n\u00bd \u0005 NOx Sunset\nE1\nFigure 2. Comparison of parameterized [Bertram and Thornton, 2009] and observed g(N2O5) as a function of the molar\nratio of H2O(l) to NO3\n assuming (a) that POM does not contribute to H2O(l) uptake and (b) that POM contributes to H2O(l)\nuptake. Data points are separated into equal population bins, where the bar and whiskers correspond to the median to mean\nrange and the interquartile range of the observations, respectively. The parameterized g(N2O5), derived from the observed\nparticle chemical composition and RH, is shown with black solid lines and the shaded region represents the propagated\nuncertainty in its determination. The dashed black line depicts g(N2O5) as parameterized for regions where direct\nmeasurements of g(N2O5) were not available.\nL19803 BERTRAM ET AL.: DIRECT OBSERVATIONS OF N2O5 REACTIVITY L19803\n3 of 5\nThe dependence of Flost on g(N2O5) and NO3 reactivity, as\ncalculated using a time-dependent chemical box model (see\nSI) for characteristic summer and winter conditions, is\nshown in Figure 3. We chose conditions (e.g., temperature\nand NO3 reactivity) in order to bracket the range of possible\nsensitivities to g(N2O5). In our summer calculations, Flost is\nprimarily limited by the NO3 production rate and nearly\nindependent of g(N2O5) due to assuming high loadings of\nbiogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC), which\nincrease NO3 reactivity, and warmer temperatures, which\nshift the N2O5-NO3 equilibrium in favor of NO3. The result\nis that at high NO3 reactivity the nocturnal loss of NOx is\nindependent of g(N2O5). During winter, BVOC emissions\nare significantly smaller, and lower temperatures shift the\nN2O5-NO3 equilibrium in favor of N2O5. As a result, Flost is\nfar more sensitive to g(N2O5) during winter than in summer.\nThese calculations illustrate the acute sensitivity of the NOx\nbudget to changes in g(N2O5) between 1  104 and 0.1\nand imply that the NOx lifetime is strongly dependent on\nNO3 reactivity at low g(N2O5).\n[15] In addition to accurate predictions of the total\nnocturnal NOx loss, models must also correctly attribute\nthat loss between the N2O5 and NO3 channels to achieve a\nrealistic sensitivity of the NOx budget to changes in VOC,\ntemperature, and particle loadings. Our modeling shows this\nbranching is sensitive to g(N2O5) for the majority of likely\nconditions. The reaction products for the two channels have\ndifferent effects on oxidant concentrations and particle mass\nloadings: the products of NO3 homogeneous reactions can\nlead to the formation of secondary organic aerosol [Ng et\nal., 2008] and the heterogeneous reaction of N2O5 can lead\nto halogen activation [Finlayson-Pitts et al., 1989] or\nincreased particulate nitrate mass [Riemer et al., 2003].\n[16] When compared to predictions of g(N2O5) made\nusing two currently implemented large-scale model parameterizations [Davis et al., 2008; Evans and Jacob, 2005],\nour directly observed reactivity values are both more\nvariable and as much as a factor of ten lower, consistent\nwith reactivity values inferred from aircraft observations of\nNO3 and N2O5 [Brown et al., 2009]. If our observations\ndescribed herein are representative of other urban\/suburban\nlocations, then incorporating the observed g(N2O5) into\ncurrent models would likely lead to increases in predicted\nO3 and OH, and an increased sensitivity of NOx loss to both\nNO3 reactivity and particle loadings.\n5. Conclusions\n[17] We present an analysis of the first direct measurements of g(N2O5) on ambient aerosol particles. At the limit\nof low POM, our observations confirm RH as a primary\ncontrol and particulate nitrate as a secondary control in\nregulating g(N2O5). Observations at high RH illustrate a\nstrong dependence of g(N2O5) on particle POM\/SO4\n2. Our\nrecent parameterization [Bertram and Thornton, 2009] can\nadequately capture the trend and variability in the observed\ng(N2O5) if we make the assumption that the increasing\nPOM mass fractions do not contribute significantly to\nadditional particulate water uptake at the same RH. In such\na case, the nitrate effect is sufficient to explain our results. If\nPOM does contribute to H2O(l) uptake, then our results\nsuggest an additional means of suppressing g(N2O5) that is\ncorrelated with oxidized POM such as organic coatings.\nRegardless, these results clearly indicate that regional and\nglobal modeling efforts need to consider the effects of\nparticulate organic loadings and hygroscopicity in parameterizing the rate of nocturnal NOx loss via N2O5 reactions\non particles.\n[18] Acknowledgments.

This guidance series has been developed to help humanitarians to access, analyze and\ninterpret common types of climate and weather data, and to provide a common language for working\nwith meteorological and hydrological services.\n\u2022 Observational rainfall data such as CHIRPS or ARC2 captures how much rain has fallen over a\ndefined period of time.\n\u2022 The rainfall is measured at weather stations or estimated through satellite or radar imagery.\n\u2022 The data can be presented as the total amount of rainfall observed over the period of time,\nor as below, at or above normal conditions.\n\u2022 Datasets that combine station data and satellite or radar imagery are the recommended\nsource of data for humanitarian purposes.\n\u2022 Observational rainfall data can be analyzed to answer a range of questions, such as:\n\u2022 What areas are currently affected by drought, and how severely?\n\u2022 What was the duration of the longest dry spell during the past rainy season?\n\u2022 How many days of heavy rainfall were there in the week leading up to the floods?\n\u2022 Which area received the most rain last month?\n\u2022 How often does an area experience dry spells?\n\u2022 How does this year\u2019s rainfall compare to previous years?\nKey takeaways\nWhat is observational rainfall data?\nObservational rainfall data captures how much rain fell over a defined period of time,\nranging from an hour to a day. This data can then be used to calculate the total rainfall for\ndifferent time periods, such as 5 days (pentad), 10 days (dekad), a week, a month or a season.\nObservational rainfall datasets can go back decades and have broad geographic coverage,\nenabling historical trend analysis and comparisons.\nObservational rainfall data is produced by measuring the amount of rainfall at precise\nlocations, which are called measuring stations or gauges (e.g., the stars in Figure 1 below).\nStation data is typically obtained from national or regional meteorological services and should\nonly be used in accordance with their guidance. Some of the advantages of station data are\nthat it is accurate at the specific locations, it is collected frequently and it has been collected\nover the long-term, allowing for trend analysis. On the other hand, station data is only\navailable for specific locations and is subject to bias due to wind, evaporation, and changes in\nmeasurement devices. Contact the local or regional meteorological services to learn whether\nstation data is available, where the stations are located, how often the data is updated, and\nwhether historical records are available.\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 3\nRainfall can also be estimated using satellite or radar images that cover areas several square\nkilometers wide (e.g., the squares in Figure 1 below). Satellite imagery is typically obtained\nby global providers and academic or research centers (e.g., the Climate Hazards Center) who\nshare their derived estimates publicly. Satellite or radar images are useful for understanding\npatterns over larger geographic areas. Some of the advantages of satellite data are that it has\nextensive geographic coverage, including in remote and inaccessible areas, and that it is shared\nin a continuous and consistent way. On the other hand, satellite measurements are subject to\nerrors due to cloud contamination, and the data has a shorter historical record.\nFigure 1. Weather Stations in Zambia (red stars). The grid superimposed onto the map consists of individual\nboxes, each of which corresponds to a particular location where satellite weather measurements are\nconducted by certain providers. In this case, the grid is the one used by the ARC2 dataset (see below). The\nsize of each box is 0.1 degree (about 11 km at the equator).\nIn order to help correct for the inaccuracies and errors that are present in the two types of data\nand take advantage of their individual strengths, research institutions have produced rainfall\ndatasets that combine station and satellite\/radar observations. Datasets that combine these\nobservations are the recommended source of data for humanitarian purposes.\nObservational precipitation data can be presented in various formats, each providing unique\ninsights into precipitation patterns. The most common representation is through absolute\nvalues, which reflect the actual amount of precipitation observed at a specific location and time,\ntypically measured in millimeters. Precipitation averages, which are calculated from historical\nrecords over a period of typically at least 10 years, can be produced for a specific location,\nseason, or year. A precipitation anomaly represents the deviation from the expected or average\nprecipitation over a particular period, which can be expressed as a difference in millimeters\nor as a percentage. The purpose of the analysis determines the most useful representation.\nAbsolute values provide insight into the total precipitation received at a location, while\nanomalies and averages help to understand long-term trends, including dry or wet periods,\nwhich is valuable for assessing drought or excessive rainfall conditions severity.\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 4\n1 https:\/\/data.humdata.org\/organization\/wfp?q=chirps\n2 The dataset spans the latitude range 50\u00b0S-50\u00b0N, and all longitudes.\n3 CHIRPS produces a preliminary version of their estimates with a latency of two days. The final version is published in the third week of the\n following month.\nCommon sources of observational rainfall data\nAmong the many sources of data available, we introduce here two common sources of\nobservational rainfall data, both of which combine station and satellite data: CHIRPS and ARC2.\nCHIRPS refers to the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data and is\nproduced by scientists from the US Geological Survey and the Climate Hazards Center at the\nUniversity of Santa Barbara. ARC2 refers to Africa Rainfall Climatology Version 2 and it is\nproduced by The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Climate Prediction Center\nfor the Famine Early Warning System. You can access the data directly from these providers, or\nuse the tabular CHIRPS datasets that provides pre-computed rainfall metrics at admin2 and is\navailable on HDX.1\nCOMPARISON OF CHIRPS AND ARC2 OBSERVATIONAL RAINFALL DATA\nSource CHIRPS ARC2\nFormat Raster Raster\nGeographical coverage Global (quasi2) Africa\nSpatial granularity\n(also referred to as spatial\nresolution)\n0.05 degree (5.5 km at the equator) 0.1 degree (11 km at the equator)\nTemporal granularity\n(aso referred to as temporal\nresolution)\nDaily rainfall3 Daily rainfall\nHistorical coverage 1981 - today 1983 - today\nPublication Every month, around the third week of\nthe following month\nEvery day, with a 2-day lag\nMost common uses \u2022 Monthly, seasonal, or yearly rainfall\nmonitoring\n\u2022 Included in other tools including\nthose used for drought monitoring and\nFEWS NET assessments\n\u2022 Trend analysis across years\n\u2022 Near real-time monitoring in Africa\n\u2022 Year-to-year comparisons in Africa\nQuestions to answer with observational rainfall data\nObservational rainfall data can be used to answer a number of questions and inform decision\nmaking in humanitarian operations. Examples include:\n\u2022 How much rain fell in the past x days\/weeks\/months? Observational rainfall datasets\nprovide data on the total amount of rainfall for an area over a discrete period of time, which\ncan be aggregated and used to calculate rainfall over different time intervals. \nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 5\n\u2022 Was the rainfall last month above or below normal? And by how much? Observational\nrainfall data goes back decades and can therefore be used to determine whether rainfall for\na month or a season is above, at or below the historical average.\n\u2022 Were there more rainy days this month than last month? Observational rainfall data is\navailable for each day and can be used to determine if it rained or not on a given day and to\ncount the number of dry or wet days during a specific period of time.\n\u2022 How many dry spells were there during the past rainy season? How long was the\nlongest dry spell and the heaviest rain streak this past rainy season? Observational\nrainfall data can be used to detect the occurrence, location and duration of dry spells and\nprolonged periods of heavy rain.\n\u2022 How often in the past decade were more than x millimeters of rainfall measured?\nObservational rainfall data provides daily rainfall totals in millimeters and can be used to\nassess how often an area received rain above or below a given threshold.\n\u2022 Which region received the most rain last month? Observational rainfall data can be\naggregated to provide rainfall totals for larger geographic areas and then used to compare\nrain for that area.\nObservational rainfall data cannot answer the following questions:\n\u2022 How much will it rain during a period of time in the future? Observational rainfall data is\nreferred to as observational because it describes what happened in the past. It does not tell\nyou anything about future rainfall.\n\u2022 Is a severe flooding event about to occur? Are we going through a severe drought?\nObservational rainfall data does not provide sufficient information to inform you about the\nrisk of flooding in the near future or how severe a drought is likely to be. This is because\nfloods and droughts are complex phenomena caused by several interacting factors and they\ncannot be explained exclusively by the amount of precipitation.\n\u2022 How much rainfall from a given period of time in the past was due to specific tropical\nstorm or typhoon? It is hard to differentiate between the amount of rain caused by\naverage atmospheric conditions and the amount of rain induced by a specific atmospheric\nphenomenon. As a result, using observational rainfall data alone, it is not possible to say how\nmuch rainfall is due strictly to a tropical storm or typhoon. More data is needed to infer the\norigin of a heavy rainfall event.\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 6\n4 Learn more: https:\/\/www.chc.ucsb.edu\/data\/chirps\n5 Learn more here: https:\/\/wiki.chc.ucsb.edu\/CHIRPS_FAQ#What_is_the_spatial_density_of_station_data_used_in_CHIRPS.3F\nCommon limitations with observations rainfall data\nOnce you have identified how you want to use the data, it is important to bear in mind some\ncommon limitations when conducting your analysis.\n1. Low-amount or short-duration rainfall may be underreported in certain geographical\nterrains or during extreme precipitation events.4 Gauges are constantly being improved\nto reduce error and datasets that combine station and satellite\/radar data are best at\ncorrecting for these limitations. However, it is still important to keep these limitations in\nmind, especially when doing analysis that is looking at meteorological events that involve\nlow-amount or short-duration rainfall, such as dry spells.\n2. There are fewer gauge stations in rural areas and certain developing countries, which\nmeans that observational rainfall data is often less accurate in these locations. Fewer gauge\nstations means that there are fewer measurements for that geographic area, resulting in\na less complete picture of what is happening on the ground. Differences in the amount of\nrainfall received in two locations might be missed if there are not stations to capture rainfall\nin both locations.5\n3. Observational rainfall data is usually provided as a raster dataset, where the geographic\narea is represented by a contiguous grid of cells, or pixels. Each cell represents a discrete\narea of land, and has a value associated with it but the cells do not neatly fit within\nadministrative boundaries. Calculating rainfall for an administrative area requires an\naggregation. The choice of the aggregation method (average, maximum, total etc.) as well\nas the choice of which cells to include within a given administrative division (all cells fully\nincluded, or all cells touched etc.) will impact the results. This is especially true for lower\nadministrative divisions. As a result, adding together the total rainfall for all the districts in a\nregion may not equal the total rainfall calculated for the region.\n4. If using station data, it is important to bear in mind that stations are easily subject to\ndeterioration and require frequent maintenance, which may affect their accuracy. For\nthis reason, calculating temporal averages, anomalies or trends over long periods of time\nshould be performed with care. When possible, verify with the provider the adequacy of\nthe measurements over long periods of time. This limitation does not apply to CHIRPS and\nARC2 datasets, which have been calibrated and combined with satellite observations by\nclimate institutions.\n5. For station data, differences exist between measuring instruments and quality of their\nmeasurements. This may heavily affect comparisons between different locations. Therefore,\nwhen performing geographical averages, it is preferable to use radar data, satellite data or\nobservational datasets already calibrated by institutions or universities such as CHIRPS or\nARC2.\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 7\nResources\n\u2022 Learn more about the CHIRPS6 and ARC27 observational datasets and\/or download data\ndirectly from the providers.\n\u2022 CHIRPS on HDX8: Download pre-computed tabular data (CSV format) on precipitation totals,\naverages, anomalies per administrative region.\n\u2022 ARC29: Download 1-month or 10-day cumulative precipitation totals (raster, tabular, image\ndata).\n\u2022 OCHA AnticiPy10: Download raster (NetCDF) data directly from CHIRPS and ARC2 using a\nPython library.\n6 https:\/\/www.chc.ucsb.edu\/data\/chirps\n7 https:\/\/www.icpac.net\/data-center\/arc2\/\n8 https:\/\/data.humdata.org\/dataset?q=CHIRPS\n9 https:\/\/gmes.icpac.net\/data-center\/arc2-rfe\n10 https:\/\/github.com\/OCHA-DAP\/ocha-anticipy\n11 https:\/\/centre.humdata.org\/\n12 https:\/\/www.climate.columbia.edu\/\n13 https:\/\/iri.columbia.edu\/\n14 https:\/\/www.knmi.nl\/over-het-knmi\/about\nThis guidance was developed by the OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data11 with input from\nColumbia University Climate School12 International Research Institute for Climate and Society13,\nthe Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute14, and the Earth Observation Unit of the Research,\nAssessment and Monitoring division of the World Food Programme."},{"from":"gpt","value":"{\n  \"centre_for_humanitarian_data\": {\n    \"guidance_series\": \"The climate crisis is intensifying humanitarian emergencies around the world and humanitarians are increasingly having to incorporate climate data and forecasts into their analysis and planning.\",\n    \"observational_rainfall_data\": {\n      \"definition\": \"Captures how much rain fell over a defined period of time\",\n      \"types\": [\n        \"station data\",\n        \"satellite or radar imagery\"\n      ],\n      \"advantages\": {\n        \"station_data\": [\n          \"accurate at specific locations\",\n          \"collected frequently\",\n          \"long-term collection allows for trend analysis\"\n        ],\n        \"satellite_data\": [\n          \"extensive geographic coverage\",\n          \"shared in a continuous and consistent way\"\n        ]\n      },\n      \"disadvantages\": {\n        \"station_data\": [\n          \"only available for specific locations\",\n          \"subject to bias due to wind, evaporation, and changes in measurement devices\"\n        ],\n        \"satellite_data\": [\n          \"subject to errors due to cloud contamination\",\n          \"shorter historical record\"\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    \"common_sources\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"CHIRPS\",\n        \"description\": \"Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data\",\n        \"provider\": \"US Geological Survey and the Climate Hazards Center at the University of Santa Barbara\",\n        \"format\": \"Raster\",\n        \"geographical_coverage\": \"Global (quasi)\",\n        \"spatial_granularity\": \"0.05 degree (5.5 km at the equator)\",\n        \"temporal_granularity\": \"Daily rainfall\",\n        \"historical_coverage\": \"1981 - today\",\n        \"publication\": \"Every month, around the third week of the following month\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"ARC2\",\n        \"description\": \"Africa Rainfall Climatology Version 2\",\n        \"provider\": \"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Climate Prediction Center for the Famine Early Warning System\",\n        \"format\": \"Raster\",\n        \"geographical_coverage\": \"Africa\",\n        \"spatial_granularity\": \"0.1 degree (11 km at the equator)\",\n        \"temporal_granularity\": \"Daily rainfall\",\n        \"historical_coverage\": \"1983 - today\",\n        \"publication\": \"Every day, with a 2-day lag\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"questions_to_answer\": [\n      \"How much rain fell in the past x days\/weeks\/months?\",\n      \"Was the rainfall last month above or below normal?

Since\nthat time, NRCS has received\n$30,883,345 for its EQIP program,\nand entered into 2,225 contracts\nwith New Mexico farmers and\nranchers for conservation improvements.\n Some 7,625,990 acres of New\nMexico farm and ranch land has\nbenefited from these conservation\npractices, or 13 percent of all\nprivate land in the state.\n Of critical importance, in a state\nwhere water and irrigation are so\nessential, over 300,000 of irrigation\nimprovements have been made\nthrough EQIP since 1996. Viewed\nanother way, NRCS has invested\n$12,389,799 to improve irrigation\nsystems, accounting for 40 percent\nof all EQIP funds. This investment\nhas resulted in installation of 364\nsprinkler systems, 600 miles of\npipeline and concrete ditches, and\nland leveling on 571 projects. All of\nthis investment has helped New\nMexicans save precious water while\nraising the agriculture products upon\nwhich this nation depends.\n Seventeen percent of the Farm\nBill funds in New Mexico have gone\nto livestock water development,\namounting to an investment of\n$5,098,856. With these funds,\nranchers have installed 450 wells,\n1,179 miles of pipeline, and 1,314\nwatering tanks.\n Another $6,632,204 has been\nexpended to alleviate brush that\nsucks water from the state\u2019s rangelands. Ranchers have treated\n363,996 acres for brush, and\naccounted for 21 percent of the\nstate\u2019s total EQIP funds to do this.\n Polls have shown that water is\none of New Mexico\u2019s top issues. It\ncontinues to garner much attention\nthroughout the state. NRCS\u2019s\nresponse to the drought in New\nMexico has been multifaceted and\nextensive. From irrigated crop lands\nto range lands, the NRCS response\nhas been felt.\nDrought in Las Vegas, New Mexico - Spring 2003\nNatural Resources Reporter\n( 2 )\nNatural Resources Reporter\nPermission is hereby granted to reprint all or any portion of this\npublication.

The 2002 Farm Bill\nhas already invested\n$6,267,457 in 151 projects in\nNew Mexico, and much more\nis to come.\n As NRCS Chief Bruce I.\nKnight said, \u201cThis is ... a great\ntime to thank the landowners\nwho have and will participate,\nto thank NRCS personnel,\nconservation districts, agricultural organizations, wildlife organizations, environmental\norganizations and all others who are all working to\noptimize the opportunities before us.\u201d\n Chief Knight said another thing that gets to the core of\nthe magnitude of this legislation.\n He said, \u201cMost agricultural producers can\u2019t quote the\n600-page 2002 Farm Bill by line and verse. But they\nknow one thing: It\u2019s helping them become better stewards. By this time next year, tens of thousands of additional farmers and ranchers will be receiving the assistance\nthey need to conserve, maintain and improve our soil, air,\nwater, and plant resources. That\u2019s because the Farm Bill\nprovides an unprecedented investment in conservation -\nranging from the Wetlands Reserve Program, to the\nEnvironmental Quality Improvement Program, to the\nWildlife Habitat Incentives Program, all of which build\nupon our base Conservation Technical Assistance programs.\u201d\n The 2002 Farm Bill is a very positive step in the\nstewardship of our treasured New Mexican land, water,\nwildlife, and other natural resources. It is always encouraging to me as I travel this state to meet and know New\nMexicans who can envision the positive, even during\ntough times. In my experience it is those who see the\npositive and strive for it that really help us progress in the\nfield of natural resources.\n While NRCS is making great strides with the Farm\nBill, our partners are setting precedents that other states\nare watching. Conservation Districts are realizing major\naccomplishments with their salt cedar projects. In\naddition, the New Mexico State Legislature appropriated\nsignificant funding for technical assistance through the Soil\nand Water Conservation Commission.\n I, also, want to take this opportunity to recognize\nsome personal achievements of our partners.

Thank you, New Mexico, for a\ngood year and the opportunity to be of service to you.\nNatural Resources Reporter\n( 3 )\nTeams work to Improve Forest Health\nby Duston L. Hunt Jr.\n Recently the smoke from five\ncontrolled burns could be seen near\nSilver City. These burns were conducted to reduce the threat of dangerous wild fire, improve wildlife habitat,\nand improve watershed conditions.\nThough the reason for these burns\nwas the same, the process required to\nconduct them was different.\n Usually the Forest Service addresses forest health issues on forest\nland with their own dollars and their\nown personnel. Two of the recent\nburns, however, were collaborative\nefforts made possible by a Memorandum of Understanding between Grant\nSoil & Water Conservation District\nand the Gila National Forest.\n Grant SWCD recognizes that the\nhazards created by 80 years of fire\ncontrol are just as real on private and\nstate land as they are on the National\nForest. Roughly 50 percent of the\nland in Grant County is private or\nstate owned, and 50 percent is\nfederal. These different lands are\nrandomly intermingled. It doesn\u2019t\nmake much sense to address the\nwildlife and watershed problems on\none side of the fence if you can\u2019t fix\nthem on the other side. Thanks to the\nMOU and a grant from the Environmental Protection Agency the forest\nhealth of the Mangas Creek watershed is being addressed in a comprehensive manner.\n First efforts to implement what is\nknown as the Mangas Water Quality\nProject were represented by the\nSchoolhouse and Cain prescribed\nburns. The 5,000-acre Schoolhouse\nburn was conducted by Forest\nService fire managers on Forest\nService land with the Grant SWCD\nconstructing numerous erosion control\nstructures within the burn area. These\nstructures will begin the process of\nhealing gullies. The 500-acre Cain\nburn was conducted entirely on\nprivate land and truly represents a\ncooperative effort. The Natural\nResources Conservation Service did\nthe initial studies and wrote the burn\nplan, while the work of conducting the\nburn was accomplished by the CliffGila Volunteer Fire Department and\nNew Mexico State Forestry. The\neffort was directed by Ricky Sedillo\nand Mike Head, both experienced\nUSDA Forest Service fire managers.\n These two burns, represent the\nfirst steps of the Mangas Water\nQuality Project, and as a result, the\nwaters of Mangas Creek and the Gila\nRiver will eventually run clearer. The\nhabitat of wildlife such as mule deer\nwill be greatly enhanced. It is also\nimportant to consider that collaborative efforts like the Mangas Water\nQuality Project provide local property\nowners a certain amount ownership in\nthe success or failure of forest restoration efforts.\n A long-term goal of the Mangas\nWater Quality Project is to heal the\ndeep erosion channel that runs the\nlength of Mangas Valley. Not much\ncan be done with the channel until the\novergrown forest condition in the\nuplands is addressed. Grant SWCD\nsees this as a long-term project,\nwhich must include the needs of\nMangas Valley residents without\nthreatening those who depend on this\nland for their livelihood. These\nresidents know they will be the ones\nto gain the most from a successful\nwatershed restoration project or have\nthe most to lose if no management is\nundertaken.\n Reprinted with permission of the Silver City SunNews and Duston L.

David\nFischer, all of the New Mexico\nNatural Resources Conservation\nService.\n The Holistic Irrigation Technology\nhas some 22 points that can guide\nirrigation districts and producers to\nthe benefits of irrigation water management.\n First, the program notes the\ninstallation of high flow structures can\nhelp improve irrigation efficiency from\nless than 25% to over 60% due to\ngreater uniformity of application with\nless water. High flow structures take\nless time to put water to the end of\nthe check, thus avoiding excessive\nsoaking of water into the ground.\nBecause high flow structures take less\ntime to irrigate there is also a savings\nin labor. The time to irrigate a field\ncan be cut in half.\n Laser leveling increases irrigation\napplication uniformity and overall\nirrigation efficiency. It is possible to\napply 2 - 3 inches of water when the\nproducer has access to a large head\nof water and fields are laser leveled\nand irrigated with high flow turnouts.\n Water metering devices enable\nproducers to evaluate and implement\nalternative practices which will\nincrease his\/her irrigation efficiency.\nThis amounts to a significant saving in\nirrigation water. For example, water\nmetered on fields that are laser\nleveled and which also have high flow\nturnouts and lined ditches, has resulted in farmers being charged as\nmuch as 40% less per irrigation.\n \u201cPutting all the hardware and\nmanagement into place can realize this\nkind of savings,\u201d Sporcic said. \u201cThe\nElephant Butte Irrigation District does\na good job and is showing the benefits of all their work. We have others\nthat are learning and working on this.\u201d\n \u201cThere is still tons of work out\nthere to do. I just can\u2019t emphasize\nthat enough.\u201d\n In addition to high flow turnouts,\nlaser leveling, and metering - measuring soil moisture can help identify\nappropriate times to irrigate thus\npreventing plant stress conditions.\nThe result is higher crop yields and\nbetter quality products that translate\ninto a better profit margin for the\nproducer. Tensiometers, probes, or\nthe feel method can be used.\n Tensiometer are filled with water\nThese efficient irrigation systems reduce evaporation of water.\nNatural Resources Reporter\n( 5 )\nand measure the suction of the soil on\nthat water. Coupled with a gauge, the\ntensiometer can show when the\nmoisture in the soil has reached such a\nlevel that it is time to water again.\nSoil texture, porosity, and crop type\ncan determine the total amount of\nwater that is needed. Lettuce, for\nexample, uses a soil zone of one foot\nwhile alfalfa uses four feet of soil.\n The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has developed a\nspread sheet that can determine the\namount of water needed for any field.\nFarmers interested in this kind of\nassistance should contact their local\nNRCS office.\n \u201cThis kind of assessment can be\ntailored to the conditions of any given\nfarm,\u201d Sporcic said. \u201cIt should go in\nevery conservation plan in New\nMexico. There just is no need to do\nwithout this valuable tool.\u201d\n Using a probe for a soil moisture\nmeasurement entails a device that has\nelectrodes and measures conductivity\nacross two rods. The more moisture\nin the soil, the greater conductivity.\n Finally, the simplest method of\nchecking soil moisture is by feel. This\ncan be a learned skill.\n All of these soil moisture testing\nsystems inherently rely on an \u201condemand\u201d irrigation system where the\nfarmer can call up the ditch rider and\nget irrigation water when needed,\nrather than on a rotational system.\n Installation of pipelines, where\nappropriate, can be used to both\nconserve and convey water very\nefficiently. Use of pipelines depends\nupon the objectives of the farmer and\nthe irrigation district. If the main\nobjective is to get water to the farm,\npipelines are effective. If an objective\nis to recharge the aquifer in the\nprocess, the alternative transport\nsystems are used.\n Another important component of a\nwell managed operation is properly\nmaintaining drains to keep the root\nzone dewatered and provides for a\nhealth growing environment. Roots\ndo not grow in water saturated soil.\nThey need air to grow. Farmers need\nfive to six feet of soil to grow crops.\n Record keeping has proven to be\nan invaluable decision making tool for\nfarmers in their efforts to irrigate more\nefficiently and effectively. NRCS has\ncreated the 449 Irrigation Management Job Sheet for this task.

NRCS staff can develop a\nnutrient budget for cropland and uses\nNew Mexico State University fertilizer recommendations which can be\nused alone or in conjunction with\ndealer recommendations.\n There is a need to check preplant\nnitrates in the spring because nitrates\nmove with water and a farmer does\nnot want to get nitrates into shallow\nwells. The goal is to keep nitrate\nreserves to a minimum for this reason,\nand the cropland may not need more.\nThis is an inexpensive test, $30 per\nfield plus time, and could cut fertilizer\ncosts by 20 percent.\n Finally, there are a variety of drip\nirrigation systems on the market today\nthat allow for the application of very\nsmall amounts of water which is\nparticularly important during early\ngrowth stages.

Bottom: San Juan pestemon\ncolors field in purple at the Los Lunas\nPlant Materials Center\n Mutton grass seed, falling to the\nblades of the harvester, recently\nmarked springtime at the Los Lunas\nPlant Materials Center. Dan\nGoodson, agronomist, was harvesting\nthe seed for National Parks throughout the southwest.\n The National Park Service relies\non the Los Lunas Plant Materials\nCenter for the production of plant\nspecies in which they are particularly\ninterested. The seed the National\nPark Service uses must meet extremely rigorous standards to prevent\ncontamination.\n \u201c The Park Service requires seeds\nthat are descendant from ecosystems\nin their parks,\u201d said Greg Fenchel,\nPlant Materials Center manager. \u201cBy\nbeing so exacting, these land managers can assure that the plants grown\nfrom these seeds can, in the long run,\ntolerate the climate extremes of the\nsites where they are sown.\u201d\n Mutton grass is important to the\nNational Park Service and others\nbecause it is very palatable to elk and\nother grazing animals. It is the dominate grass component under Ponderosa pine. Like the Ponderosa pine it\nrequires significant water, 16 - 20\ninches per annum. In New Mexico it\nis typically found in 7000 - 9000 foot\naltitude areas. There is some debate\nabout its use after fires, and there are\narguments why mutton grass should\nbe used and why small grains are\npreferred. Regardless of the debate,\nmutton grass is important in our\nNational Parks and forestlands\nthroughout the southwest.\n Like the harvesting of mutton\ngrass, the blooming of the San Juan\npestemon recently signaled the return\nof warm weather at the Plant Materials Center. The pestemon is a wildflower, great for xerioscaping in\nyards, along highways, and anywhere\nwhere drought resistant flowers are\nneeded.\n \u201cIn the Albuquerque area,\npestemon will thrive without any\nirrigation, and at the Plant Material\nCenter in Los Lunas is grown without\nirrigation,\u201d said Fenchel. \u201cIt typically\nrequires only 7 - 8 inches of water a\nyear.\u201d\n It is a busy time for the Plant\nMaterial Center as it enters its production season.

Brook\u2019s perspective results\nfrom managing a field office for the\nstate\u2019s most urbanized conservation\ndistrict.\n \u201cIn general the healing or improving of land does not happen overnight,\nBrooks said. \u201cMost of our traditional\nagriculture producers know this. The\nland is their livelihood and they know\nhow to care for the land, and have the\nforesight to do the proper planning.\u201d\n The urbanized Albuquerque\ndistrict has many non-traditional\nagriculture producers however,\nincluding hobby farmers, first time\nirrigators, and small acreage landowners. Many of these individuals may\nbe on the learning curve, and want\ninstant results or are reacting to the\ndry conditions rather than anticipating\nthem.\n This complex mosaic of producers\nand land management skill levels\nmake Brooks\u2019 job both challenging\nand rewarding as she helps individuals\nwith varied backgrounds bring\nconservation to the land.\n \u201cI am not saying that other district\nconservationists don\u2019t also have\nchallenging jobs. It is just that the\nvariety of situations in an area bordering the largest urban center in the state\nkeeps you on your toes,\u201d said\nBrooks.\n Brooks also shared a perspective\nabout the drought.\n \u201cThis period of drier conditions\nmay not really be a drought. Climate\nexperts point to recent wet years as\nbeing above normal and what we\nhave now may be closer to the norm.\u201d\n Weather forecasters agree that this\ndry period for New Mexico may be\nextended. Planners and politicians\nalike are calling for the need for\nplanning for extensive dry periods in\nNew Mexico, and conservation and\ndevelopment of available water\nsources.\n Brooks says she does have\nproducers who are adjusting to the\ndry conditions.\n \u201cWe do have producers who are\nadjusting crop rotations. By this I\nmean they may turn alfalfa into a crop\nthat uses less water on the fifth year of\nthe crop rather than let the alfalfa go\nanother two or three years.\u201d\n Land leveling and irrigation are\namong other measures Albuquerque\nproducers are taking. Irrigation\nimprovements concentrate on improvements such as pipelines instead\nof earthen ditches, ditch lining, and\nnew turnouts.\n \u201cThese are by far the majority of\npractices we are dealing with,\u201d\nBrooks said.\n \u201cFinally a concern of ours is the\nnumber of animals on the land\nwhether it be irrigated pasture or\nrangeland.\u201d\n In drought livestock producers\ncannot produce the forage for the\nanimals they can during wet years.\n \u201cThe same principles apply for the\nsmall producer on five acres with only\nthree or four cows. That producer\nmay need to get rid of one cow during\ndry spells, while the large rancher may\nneed to get rid of a hundred. They\nstill have to cut back on the number of\nanimals they are carrying on the land.\u201d\n For more information about an\nurbanized field office, contact Corinne\nBrooks at (505)761-5444.\nCorinne Brooks, Albuquerque District Conservationist\nNatural Resources Reporter\nNew Mexico NRCS Field Team Contacts:\nNorman Vigil\nNorthwest Team\nCook\u2019s Professional Building\n224 Los Alamos Avenue, Suite 1\nEspanola, NM 87532\n(505)753-6412\nBen Creighton\nNortheast Team\n51 Santa Fe Drive\nClayton, NM 88415\n(505)374-1002\nDan Thomas\nCentral Team\nAgricultural Service Center Bldg. 27\nCourthouse Road\nLos Lunas, NM 87031\n(505)865-4642\nJohn Allen\nSouthwest Team\n2507 North Telshor\nLas Cruces, NM 88001\n(505)521-8119\nHollis Fuchs\nSoutheast Team\n409 Central Avenue\nCarrizozo, NM 88301\n(505)648-2941\nKen Walker\nEast Team\n918 Parkland\nClovis, NM 88101\n(505)762-4769 x119\nPublic Affairs\nNatural Resources Conservation Service\n6200 Jefferson NE\nAlbuquerque, NM 87109"},{"from":"gpt","value":"{\"report\": {\"title\": \"Natural Resources Reporter\", \"publisher\": \"New Mexico Natural Resources Conservation Service - U.S. Department of Agriculture\", \"publicationDate\": \"Summer 2003\", \"articles\": [{\"title\": \"NRCS Responds to Drought in New Mexico\", \"content\": \"Farm Bill EQIP Funds Devoted to Drought Related Practices\"}, {\"title\": \"2002 Farm Bill Celebrates First Anniversary\", \"content\": \"Much More Is To Come\"}, {\"title\": \"Teams work to Improve Forest Health\", \"content\": \"by Duston L.

SUMMARY\nThis matter concerns the roles of audit firm Altschuler, Melvoin and Glasser LLP\n(\u201cAltschuler\u201d) and engagement partner George Victor Johnson, II (\u201cJohnson\u201d) in violations of\nSection 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-2 (the \u201cCustody Rule\u201d) under the Advisers\nAct by Sentinel Management Group, Inc. (\u201cSentinel\u201d), a registered investment adviser. At the\nrelevant time, 2002 through 2006, Sentinel was required by the Custody Rule to have an\nindependent public accountant verify all client funds and securities by surprise examination at\nleast once each calendar year. Altschuler was the independent public accounting firm that\nSentinel retained to perform its surprise examinations from 2002 through 2006, and Johnson was\nthe engagement partner at Altschuler overseeing the Sentinel surprise examinations for every\nyear except 2004.4\n The Respondents negligently failed to conduct the examinations in\naccordance with the professional standards applicable to examinations under Advisers Act Rule\n206(4)-2, thereby causing Sentinel\u2019s violations of the Custody Rule and Section 206(4) of the\nor improper professional conduct; or (3) to have willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of,\nany provision of the securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.\u201d\n2\n Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) provides, in relevant part, that:\nThe Commission may censure or deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing\nbefore it \u2026 to any person \u2026 who is found \u2026 to have engaged in improper professional conduct.\n3\n The findings herein are made pursuant to the Respondents' Offers of Settlement and are not binding on any other\nperson or entity in this or in any other proceeding.\n4 Johnson did not act as the engagement partner for 2004 because Johnson and Altschuler, without admitting or\ndenying its findings, consented in June 2005, to the entry of an order, which required Johnson to refrain from\nserving as an engagement partner in any audit of any CFTC registrant for six months. See In the Matter of G. Victor\nJohnson and Altschuler, Melvoin and Glasser, LLP, CFTC Docket No. 04-29 (June 13, 2005).\n2\n \n\n\n\nAdvisers Act. The conduct related to the exams also constituted improper professional conduct\npursuant to Section 4C(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commission\u2019s\nRules of Practice.\nB. RESPONDENTS\nAltschuler, Melvoin and Glasser LLP is an Illinois limited liability partnership that\nmaintained its principal place of business in Chicago, Illinois. Altschuler performed annual\nAdvisers Act surprise examinations for Sentinel, a registered investment adviser, for the years\n2002 through 2006 and also served as Sentinel\u2019s independent auditor from 2002 through 2005.\nOn November 1, 2006, Altschuler sold most of its assets to another public accounting firm and is\nnow in liquidation. Altschuler is, however, contractually required to complete any pending\nengagements, sign-off on report reissuance and consents, and defend malpractice claims.\nGeorge Victor Johnson, II, CPA age 69, of Arlington Heights, Illinois is a certified\npublic accountant licensed in Illinois and currently a director of a public accounting firm.\nJohnson served as the engagement partner for the 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006 Advisers Act\nsurprise examinations of Sentinel and the 2002 through 2005 financial statement audits of\nSentinel on behalf of Altschuler.\nC. OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY\nSentinel Management Group, Inc. (SEC File No. 801-15642) is an Illinois corporation\nbased in Northbrook, Illinois, that has been registered with the Commission as an investment\nadviser since 1980. Sentinel is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a\nfutures commission merchant. On August 17, 2007, Sentinel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At\nthe time of Sentinel\u2019s bankruptcy, Sentinel managed approximately 180 accounts for around 70\nclients and had approximately $1.4 billion in assets under management.\nD. FACTS\n1. The Commission\u2019s Action Against Sentinel\na. Prior to its bankruptcy on August 17, 2007, Sentinel primarily managed\ninvestments of short-term cash for advisory clients, including futures commission merchants,\nhedge funds, financial institutions, pension funds, and individuals. Sentinel purported to invest all\nof its clients\u2019 assets in pooled investment vehicles (the \u201cSecurities Pools\u201d) 5\n and to hold the\nunderlying securities in three segregated accounts at a qualified custodian bank (the \u201cCustodian\u201d).\nb. Sentinel obtained a loan, for its own benefit, from the Custodian and\nestablished a collateral account at the Custodian to maintain securities pledged as collateral for this\nloan. During the relevant period, the loan from the Custodian to Sentinel was similar to a line of\ncredit in that it fluctuated on a daily basis. The outstanding balance of the loan grew significantly\nfrom when Altschuler first began performing Advisers Act surprise examinations for Sentinel to\nthe days leading up to Sentinel\u2019s bankruptcy. For example, the loan balance was approximately\n5 Advisory clients owned pro-rata, undivided interests in the Securities Pools.\n3\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$20 million at December 31, 2002, approximately $120 million at December 31, 2004, and\napproximately $230 million at December 31, 2006. On August 20, 2007, the Commission filed an\nemergency enforcement action against Sentinel in the United States District Court in Illinois\nalleging multiple violations of the antifraud provisions of the Advisers Act. According to the\nCommission\u2019s complaint against Sentinel, Sentinel misused Securities Pools\u2019 securities to\ncollateralize the loan. When Sentinel collapsed in August 2007, the Custodian claimed ownership\nof several hundred million dollars in Securities Pool securities that had been improperly held in\nSentinel\u2019s account to collateralize the loan made by the Custodian to Sentinel for the benefit of\nSentinel. On December 17, 2008, the court entered a judgment by consent against Sentinel\npermanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.\n2. Altschuler\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s Unreasonable Advisers Act Surprise Examinations\nCaused Sentinel\u2019s Violations of the Custody Rule\na. Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act prohibits investment advisers from\nengaging in \u201cany act, practice, or course of business which is fraudulent, deceptive, or\nmanipulative,\u201d as defined by the Commission by rule. During the relevant period, Rule 206(4)-2\nstated in pertinent part that it constitutes a fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative act, practice or\ncourse of business within the meaning of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act for any registered\ninvestment adviser to have custody of client funds or securities unless a qualified custodian or the\nadviser sends a quarterly account statement to each of the clients for which it maintains funds or\nsecurities, or to each beneficial owner of a pooled investment vehicle, identifying the amount of\nfunds and of each security in the account at the end of the period and setting forth all transactions\nin the account during the period.6\n If the adviser sends the quarterly account statements itself,\nwhich Sentinel did, an independent public accountant generally must verify all of the funds and\nsecurities by actual examination at least once during each calendar year on a date chosen by the\naccountant without prior notice to the investment adviser (a \u201csurprise examination\u201d). 7\nb. The Commission provided guidance for accountants conducting surprise\nexaminations in Accounting Series Release No. 1038\n which indicates, among other things, that the\naccountant should express an opinion as to whether the investment adviser was in compliance with\nRule 206(4)-2(a)(1) as of the examination date. Rule 206(4)-2(a)(1) requires, among other things,\nclient assets of which the adviser has custody to be maintained by a qualified custodian (i) in a\nseparate account for each client under that client\u2019s name or (ii) in accounts that contain only [the\nadviser\u2019s] clients\u2019 funds and securities, under [the adviser\u2019s] name as agent or trustee for the\nclients.\n6 Prior to the effectiveness of the 2003 amendments to Rule 206(4)-2, Rule 206(4)-2 was not materially different\nwith regard to those parts of the rule relevant to the violations at issue in this matter.\n7\n Rule 206(4)-2(b)(3) provided an exception from the surprise examination requirement for a pooled investment\nvehicle if certain criteria were met, including, among other things, a financial-statement audit of the pool. This\nprovision, however, is not relevant here because the Securities Pools were not audited.\n8 Statement of the Commission describing nature of examination required to be made of all funds and securities held\nby an investment adviser and the content of related accountant's certificate, Accounting Series Release No. 103,\nInvestment Advisers Act Release No. 201 (May 26, 1966) (\u201cASR No. 103\u201d).\n4\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nc. During the relevant period, Sentinel was required to undergo surprise\nexaminations by an independent public accountant. 9 To conduct an appropriate examination under\nRule 206(4)-2, an accountant should have, among other things:10\n\u2022        Confirmed all Securities Pool securities held by the Custodian.\n\u2022        Reconciled all securities between the Custodian\u2019s records and the adviser\u2019s\nrecords of the client accounts.\n\u2022        Conducted the examination by \u201csurprise.\u201d\n\u2022        Completed the surprise examination in accordance with U.S. Generally\nAccepted Auditing or Attestation Standards as established by the American\nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants (\u201cAICPA Attest\nStandards\u201d)(emphasis added).\nd. Rule 206(4)-2 also states that the accountant is to transmit to the\nCommission, within 30 days after the completion of the examination, a certificate, attached to a\nForm ADV-E, stating that an examination of such funds and securities has been made, and\ndescribing the nature and extent of the examination.\ne. The AICPA also provided guidance concerning the examination and\nreporting requirements of Rule 206(4)-2 in the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide: Audits of\nInvestment Companies (\u201cAICPA Guide\u201d). The AICPA Guide contained an illustrative attestation\nreport for independent public accountants for surprise examinations performed pursuant to Rule\n206(4)-2.11 According to the AICPA Guide, the attestation report should, if applicable, include\nspecific references to the following procedures performed by the independent accountant in\nconnection with the surprise examination: (1) confirmation of all cash and securities held by a third\nparty, such as a custodian bank or broker, in the name of the investment adviser as agent or trustee\nfor clients; and (2) reconciliation of all such cash and securities to books and records of client\naccounts maintained by the investment adviser. These procedures were applicable to the Sentinel\nsurprise examinations. Additionally, the illustrative attestation report contained an opinion on\nmanagement\u2019s assertion regarding compliance with, among other things, Rule 206(4)-2(a)(1) based\non the aforementioned procedures.\n9 Prior to Nov. 5, 2003, the Custody Rule required all registered advisers to have surprise examinations. See\nAdvisers Act Release No. 2176 (Sept. 25, 2003) (amending the rule). Thus, Sentinel was required to have the\nSecurities Pools\u2019 assets verified by surprise examination under the Custody Rule, as it existed prior to Nov. 5, 2003.\nIt also was required to have surprise examinations after the rule\u2019s amendment in 2003 because it, not its custodian,\nsent account statements to the investors in the Securities Pools. See Rule 206(4)-2(a)(3)(iii) (the account statements\nrequired to be sent under Paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of the Rule must be sent to each beneficial owner of a pooled\ninvestment vehicle). The Commission amended Rule 206(4)-2 in December 2009 to require registered investment\nadvisers with custody of client assets to have surprise examinations annually, subject to certain exceptions, as well\nas require that qualified custodians holding those assets send out account statements. See Advisers Act Release No.\n2968 (Dec. 30, 2009). Unless otherwise noted, references to the Rule refer to its provisions as it existed prior to its\nmost recent amendment.\n10 See Rule 206(4)-2; ASR No. 103 and Advisers Act Release No. 2176 (Sept. 25, 2003).\n11 See, e.g., paragraph 11.12 of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Investment Companies, with\nconforming changes as of May 1, 2002.\n5\n \nf. While conducting these examinations, Altschuler and Johnson negligently\nfailed to meet the AICPA attestation standard requiring \u201cdue professional care.\u201d See AT 101A.39\n(AICPA 2002). For example, Johnson knew in 2002 of Sentinel\u2019s loan from the Custodian. He\nalso was informed that Sentinel regularly transferred securities, originally purchased for the\nSecurities Pools, from segregated accounts held at the Custodian to Sentinel\u2019s collateral account at\nthe Custodian. In addition, Altschuler and Johnson obtained documents from the Custodian\nduring each of the surprise examinations (e.g., collateral account statement confirmations from the\nCustodian) that reflected securities purportedly owned by the Securities Pools were held in\nSentinel\u2019s collateral account at the Custodian, which Johnson knew or should have known also\ncontained Sentinel owned securities. Although the collateral account statements they received\nfrom the Custodian were in Sentinel\u2019s name and the securities in the account were not marked for\nthe benefit of the Securities Pools, Altschuler and Johnson included the securities in this account in\ntheir reconciliations of the Custodian\u2019s records to the Adviser\u2019s records. Altschuler and Johnson\nshould have recognized that Sentinel was holding some securities purportedly owned by the\nSecurities Pools in a Sentinel account at the Custodian and that such practice did not comply with\nRule 206(4)-2(a)(1). Moreover, certain securities were shown in Sentinel\u2019s records as being held\nin the Securities Pools\u2019 segregated accounts, whereas such securities were shown in the\nCustodian\u2019s records as being held only in Sentinel\u2019s collateral account. The examination work\npapers further reveal that Altschuler and Johnson obtained certain schedules (including account\nstatements of investors in the Securities Pools) that showed Sentinel was using as collateral for its\nloan certain Securities Pools\u2019 securities which were maintained in Sentinel\u2019s collateral account,\ncommingled with Sentinel\u2019s own assets.\ng. Nonetheless, based primarily on oral statements from Sentinel\u2019s\nmanagement, Altschuler and Johnson had reached the conclusion that Sentinel owned the securities\nused to collateralize the loan, contrary to certain documentary evidence in the examination work\npapers and elsewhere, and therefore they failed to follow up adequately on the inconsistencies or to\ndesign procedures to discover whether the Securities Pools\u2019 securities were being commingled.\nh. In addition, from 2002-2006, Johnson (for every year other than 2004) and\nAltschuler issued unqualified attestation opinions that stated that Sentinel\u2019s assertions regarding its\ncompliance with Rule 206(4)-2(a)(1) for the examination periods were fairly stated in all material\nrespects. However, as a result of procedures performed and evidence obtained, Altschuler and\nJohnson should have known that Sentinel was not complying with Rule 206(4)-2(a)(1) because\nSentinel was commingling the Securities Pools\u2019 securities in its collateral account. Therefore,\nAltschuler and\/or Johnson should not have issued unqualified attestation opinions.\ni. In addition, contrary to the Custody Rule, Altschuler and Johnson failed to\nconduct all of their examinations of Sentinel by surprise either by providing prior notice of the\nexamination or in one instance allowing Sentinel to choose the date of the exam.\nj. Finally, Johnson also failed to provide sufficient supervision to the\nAltschuler staff members that were tasked to complete the surprise examinations. Johnson billed\nonly 1.5 hours a year on the examinations and during that time provided little apparent guidance to\nthe staff members carrying out the examinations. Such inadequate guidance and poor supervision\nfall short of the requirement of the AICPA Attestation Standards\u2019 first standard of field work that\n\u201cassistants, if any, shall be properly supervised.\u201d See AT 101A.42 (AICPA 2002).\n6\n \n\n\n3. Altschuler and Johnson Engaged in Improper Professional Conduct\na. During the examinations of Sentinel from 2002 through 2006, the\nRespondents engaged in improper professional conduct.\nb. During each examination conducted, the Respondents (1) failed to\nrecognize that certain custodial-client securities (i.e., some of those of the Securities Pools) were\nheld in accounts that did not comply with subparagraph (a)(1) of Rule 206(4)-2 because such\nsecurities were in Sentinel\u2019s collateral account which was not marked as for the benefit of the\ncustodial clients (i.e., the Securities Pools); (2) failed to properly reconcile Sentinel\u2019s Securities\nPool accounts to the account statements received directly from the Custodian; (3) inaccurately\nstated in their opinions that Sentinel complied with subparagraph (a)(1) of Rule 206(4)-2; (4) failed\nto conduct all of their examinations on a surprise basis; and (5) failed to file the examination report\nwithin 30 days of completing the examinations. The Respondents also failed to appreciate that\nheightened scrutiny was warranted in connection with their examinations of Sentinel because of\nthe growing size of Sentinel\u2019s loan from the Custodian, which resulted in Sentinel transferring\nsecurities from the Securities Pools\u2019 segregated accounts to its collateral account to collateralize its\nloan.\nc. The Respondents failed to conduct the examinations in accordance with the\nAICPA Attestation Standards, which are the professional standards applicable to the examinations\nperformed under Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-2.\nd. Section 4C of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) provide that the\nCommission may censure or temporarily or permanently deny an accountant the privilege of\nappearing or practicing before it if it finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the\naccountant engaged in \u201cimproper professional conduct.\u201d In relevant part, Section 4C(b) and Rule\n102(e)(1)(iv) define \u2018improper professional conduct\u2019 to include either of the following two types of\nnegligent conduct:\n(1) A single instance of highly unreasonable conduct that results in a violation of\napplicable professional standards in circumstances in which an accountant, or a\nperson associated with a registered public accounting firm, knows, or should know,\nthat heightened scrutiny is warranted, or\n(2) Repeated instances of unreasonable conduct, each resulting in a violation of\napplicable professional standards, that indicate a lack of competence to practice\nbefore the Commission.\n4.
