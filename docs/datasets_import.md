# Importing Datasets or Benchmarks

## Overview

It's possible to import existing datasets, benchmarks and benchmark results into pyFADE.
Import Wizard allows to filter the data, focusing on specific goals for targeted, high-quality training data.


## LM Eval Benchmarking Results Import

For targeted improvement of model performance on specific benchmarks, it's possible to import existing benchmarking results from LM Eval framework, selecting only failed samples for retraining.
It's also possible to import paired results, for example from base and tuned models, and import only samples where tuned model failed while base model succeeded, to focus on regression issues.
